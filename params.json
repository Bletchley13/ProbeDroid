  "body": "# **ProbeDroid**  \r\n\r\nA ***dynamic binary instrumentation toolkit*** for analysts to manipulate application on the fly. Currently, it targets on ***Android(L) 5.0*** and ***Intel-x86 ISA***, the  support for the newest Android and other machine architectures would be provided in the near future. In short, ProbeDroid offers a ***Java library*** for analysts to craft their own instrumentation packages. Analysts can register hooks to monitor the interested Java methods. Furthermore, by modifying the method arguments and return value, the application behavior can be dynamically altered as they wish.  However, ProbeDroid ***has only been tested in AVD***. For the real phone deployment, the stability is not guaranteed.  Specifically, you have to root the phone.\r\n\r\n",
